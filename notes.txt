//public is an access modifier.
/*the JVM calls tha main()method outside the class.
 therefore it is necesary to make java main()method pubic.
*/
/*static is a keyword.
Main advantage is we can call main()without 
creating class instances.

/**Primitive data type
 * boolean
 * char
 * int
 * float
 * double
 * byte
 * short
 * long
 * 
 * Non-Primitive data type: refer to as object.
 *arraylist,string and classes are the e.gs.
 * 
 */
 /*
 if you want to define float value,
 f should be entered with value, if you don't do that
 it will be read as double data type,you 
 would encounter an complication error

 */**Variable scopes
 * local variable scope
    defined inside a block,method body 
    or constructor
 *cannot be accessed outside the method.
 */

 /*
 Variable declared inside methodbody cannot
 be accessed outside methodbody.

 /*There are three types of variables
 *local variable:defined inside block,method 
 body or constructor
 *Instance(object) variables:defined inside class but 
 outside block,methodbody.Non-static
 *Static variable:known as class variables.

 /*TypeCasting
 Process of converting 1 Primitivedata into another.
 done auto or explicitly.

 TYpes of TypeCasting
 *widening or automatic type conversion
 /*
 byte>short>int>long>float>double
 */
 *narrowing or explicit type conversion

 /*Overflow:
 when we assign value to variable more than 
 its range.
 *underflow:
 opposite of Overflow.
//**
For e.g. if i increment the max value of int 
it will return min value of int,
this is Overflow

/*unlike print() and println()
printf() takes multiple args
/*Format specifiers: used by printf {Just like in C}
%d for int
%f for float
%s for string

/*In java to take input there are 2 ways/
1**. Scanner class
2**.BufferedReader class

/**/Scanner is a class to take input.
/**/Present in java.util package.
/**/Most preferable ways for input.
/**/Input from Primitivedata.
Read data
syntax:/*next(Datatype)()
/**/nextInt() = for interger
/**/nextLine() = for line of text
/**/
